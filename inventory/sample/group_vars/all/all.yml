## Directory where the binaries will be installed

## The access_ip variable is used to define how other nodes should access
## the node.  This is used in flannel to allow other flannel nodes to see
## this node for example.  The access_ip is really useful AWS and Google
## environments where the nodes are accessed remotely by the "public" ip,
## but don't know about that address themselves.
# access_ip: 1.1.1.1


## External LB example config
## apiserver_loadbalancer_domain_name: "elb.some.domain"
# loadbalancer_apiserver:
#   address: 1.2.3.4
#   port: 1234

## Internal loadbalancers for apiservers
# loadbalancer_apiserver_localhost: true
# valid options are "nginx" or "haproxy"
# loadbalancer_apiserver_type: nginx  # valid values "nginx" or "haproxy"

## Local loadbalancer should use this port
## And must be set port 6443
loadbalancer_apiserver_port: 6443

## If loadbalancer_apiserver_healthcheck_port variable defined, enables proxy liveness check for nginx.
loadbalancer_apiserver_healthcheck_port: 8081

### OTHER OPTIONAL VARIABLES

## Upstream dns servers
# upstream_dns_servers:
#   - 8.8.8.8

## There are some changes specific to the cloud providers
## for instance we need to encapsulate packets with some network plugins
## If set the possible values are either 'gce', 'aws', 'azure', 'openstack', 'vsphere', 'oci', or 'external'
## When openstack is used make sure to source in the openstack credentials
## like you would do when using openstack-client before starting the playbook.
# cloud_provider:

## When cloud_provider is set to 'external', you can set the cloud controller to deploy
## Supported cloud controllers are: 'openstack' and 'vsphere'
## When openstack or vsphere are used make sure to source in the required fields

## Some problems may occur when downloading files over https proxy due to ansible bug
## https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/32750. Set this variable to False to disable
## SSL validation of get_url module. Note that kubespray will still be performing checksum validation.
# download_validate_certs: False

## If you need exclude all cluster nodes from proxy and other resources, add other resources here.
# additional_no_proxy: ""

## Certificate Management
## This setting determines whether certs are generated via scripts.
## Chose 'none' if you provide your own certificates.
## Option is  "script", "none"
## note: vault is removed
