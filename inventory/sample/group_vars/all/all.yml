## Directory where etcd data stored

## Directory where the binaries will be installed
bin_dir: /usr/local/bin

## The access_ip variable is used to define how other nodes should access
## the node.  This is used in flannel to allow other flannel nodes to see
## this node for example.  The access_ip is really useful AWS and Google
## environments where the nodes are accessed remotely by the "public" ip,
## but don't know about that address themselves.
#access_ip: 1.1.1.1


## External LB example config
## apiserver_loadbalancer_domain_name: "elb.some.domain"
#loadbalancer_apiserver:
#  address: 1.2.3.4
#  port: 1234

## Internal loadbalancers for apiservers
#loadbalancer_apiserver_localhost: true

## Local loadbalancer should use this port instead, if defined.
## Defaults to kube_apiserver_port (6443)
#nginx_kube_apiserver_port: 8443

### OTHER OPTIONAL VARIABLES
## For some things, kubelet needs to load kernel modules.  For example, dynamic kernel services are needed
## for mounting persistent volumes into containers.  These may not be loaded by preinstall kubernetes
## processes.  For example, ceph and rbd backed volumes.  Set to true to allow kubelet to load kernel
## modules.
#kubelet_load_modules: false

## Upstream dns servers used by dnsmasq
#upstream_dns_servers:
#  - 8.8.8.8
#  - 8.8.4.4

## There are some changes specific to the cloud providers
## for instance we need to encapsulate packets with some network plugins
## If set the possible values are either 'gce', 'aws', 'azure', 'openstack', 'vsphere', 'oci', or 'external'
## When openstack is used make sure to source in the openstack credentials
## like you would do when using nova-client before starting the playbook.

## Uncomment to enable experimental kubeadm deployment mode

## Some problems may occur when downloading files over https proxy due to ansible bug
## https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/32750. Set this variable to False to disable
## SSL validation of get_url module. Note that kubespray will still be performing checksum validation.
#download_validate_certs: False

## If you need exclude all cluster nodes from proxy and other resources, add other resources here.
#additional_no_proxy: ""

## Certificate Management
## This setting determines whether certs are generated via scripts or whether a
## cluster of Hashicorp's Vault is started to issue certificates (using etcd
## as a backend). Options are "script" or "vault"
#cert_management: script

## Set to true to allow pre-checks to fail and continue deployment
#ignore_assert_errors: false

## The read-only port for the Kubelet to serve on with no authentication/authorization. Uncomment to enable.
