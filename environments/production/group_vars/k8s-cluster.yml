# Internal DNS configuration.
# Kubernetes can create and mainatain its own DNS server to resolve service names
# into appropriate IP addresses. It's highly advisable to run such DNS server,
# as it greatly simplifies configuration of your applications - you can use
# service names instead of magic environment variables.
# You still must manually configure all your containers to use this DNS server,
# Kubernetes won't do this for you (yet).
