## Etcd auto compaction retention for mvcc key value store in hour
# etcd_compaction_retention: 0

## Set level of detail for etcd exported metrics, specify 'extensive' to include histogram metrics.
# etcd_metrics: basic

## Etcd is restricted by default to 512M on systems under 4GB RAM, 512MB is not enough for much more than testing.
## Set this if your etcd nodes have less than 4GB but you want more RAM for etcd. Set to 0 for unrestricted RAM.
## This value is only relevant when deploying etcd with `etcd_deployment_type: docker`
# etcd_memory_limit: "512M"

## Etcd has a default of 2G for its space quota. If you put a value in etcd_memory_limit which is less than
## etcd_quota_backend_bytes, you may encounter out of memory terminations of the etcd cluster. Please check
## etcd documentation for more information.
# 8G is a suggested maximum size for normal environments and etcd warns at startup if the configured value exceeds it.
# etcd_quota_backend_bytes: "2147483648"

# Maximum client request size in bytes the server will accept.
# etcd is designed to handle small key value pairs typical for metadata.
# Larger requests will work, but may increase the latency of other requests
# etcd_max_request_bytes: "1572864"

### ETCD: disable peer client cert authentication.
# This affects ETCD_PEER_CLIENT_CERT_AUTH variable
# etcd_peer_client_auth: true

## Enable distributed tracing
## To enable this experimental feature, set the etcd_experimental_enable_distributed_tracing: true, along with the
## etcd_experimental_distributed_tracing_sample_rate to choose how many samples to collect per million spans,
## the default sampling rate is 0 https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/op-guide/monitoring/#distributed-tracing
# etcd_experimental_enable_distributed_tracing: false
# etcd_experimental_distributed_tracing_sample_rate: 100
# etcd_experimental_distributed_tracing_address: "localhost:4317"
# etcd_experimental_distributed_tracing_service_name: etcd
