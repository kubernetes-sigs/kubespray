                        description: keySecretRef is a Secret Key Selector referencing
                          a data item in a Kubernetes Secret which holds the symmetric
                          MAC key of the External Account Binding. The `key` is the
                          index string that is paired with the key data in the Secret
                          and should not be confused with the key data itself, or
                          indeed with the External Account Binding keyID above. The
                          secret key stored in the Secret **must** be un-padded, base64
                          URL encoded data.
