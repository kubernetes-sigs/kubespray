  # see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-lint/rules/default_rules.html for a list of all default rules

  # DO NOT add any other rules to this skip_list, instead use local `# noqa` with a comment explaining WHY it is necessary

  # These rules are intentionally skipped:
  #
  # [E204]: "Lines should be no longer than 160 chars"
  # This could be re-enabled with a major rewrite in the future.
  # For now, there's not enough value gain from strictly limiting line length.
  # (Disabled in May 2019)
  - '204'

  # [E701]: "meta/main.yml should contain relevant info"
  # Roles in Kubespray are not intended to be used/imported by Ansible Galaxy.
  # While it can be useful to have these metadata available, they are also available in the existing documentation.
  # (Disabled in May 2019)
  - '701'

  # [role-name] "meta/main.yml" Role name role-name does not match ``^+$`` pattern
  # Meta roles in Kubespray don't need proper names
  # (Disabled in June 2021)
  - 'role-name'

  - 'experimental'
  # [var-naming] "defaults/main.yml" File defines variable 'apiVersion' that violates variable naming standards
  # In Kubespray we use variables that use camelCase to match their k8s counterparts
  # (Disabled in June 2021)
  - 'var-naming'
  - 'var-spacing'

  # [fqcn-builtins]
  # Roles in kubespray don't need fully qualified collection names
  # (Disabled in Feb 2023)
  - 'fqcn-builtins'
