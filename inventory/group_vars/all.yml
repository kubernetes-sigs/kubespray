# Valid bootstrap options (required): ubuntu, coreos, centos, none
bootstrap_os: ubuntu

#Directory where etcd data stored
etcd_data_dir: /var/lib/etcd

# Directory where the binaries will be installed
bin_dir: /usr/local/bin

## The access_ip variable is used to define how other nodes should access
## the node.  This is used in flannel to allow other flannel nodes to see
## this node for example.  The access_ip is really useful AWS and Google
## environments where the nodes are accessed remotely by the "public" ip,
## but don't know about that address themselves.
#access_ip: 1.1.1.1

### LOADBALANCING AND ACCESS MODES
## Enable multiaccess to configure etcd clients to access all of the etcd members directly
## as the "http://hostX:port, http://hostY:port, ..." and ignore the proxy loadbalancers.
## This may be the case if clients support and loadbalance multiple etcd servers  natively.
#etcd_multiaccess: true

## External LB example config
## apiserver_loadbalancer_domain_name: "elb.some.domain"
#loadbalancer_apiserver:
#  address: 1.2.3.4
#  port: 1234

## Internal loadbalancers for apiservers
#loadbalancer_apiserver_localhost: true

## Local loadbalancer should use this port instead, if defined.
## Defaults to kube_apiserver_port (6443)
#nginx_kube_apiserver_port: 8443

### OTHER OPTIONAL VARIABLES
## For some things, kubelet needs to load kernel modules.  For example, dynamic kernel services are needed
## for mounting persistent volumes into containers.  These may not be loaded by preinstall kubernetes
## processes.  For example, ceph and rbd backed volumes.  Set to true to allow kubelet to load kernel
## modules.
# kubelet_load_modules: false

## Internal network total size. This is the prefix of the
## entire network. Must be unused in your environment.
#kube_network_prefix: 18

## With calico it is possible to distributed routes with border routers of the datacenter.
## Warning : enabling router peering will disable calico's default behavior ('node mesh').
## The subnets of each nodes will be distributed by the datacenter router
#peer_with_router: false

## Upstream dns servers used by dnsmasq
#upstream_dns_servers:
#  - 8.8.8.8
#  - 8.8.4.4

## There are some changes specific to the cloud providers
## for instance we need to encapsulate packets with some network plugins
## If set the possible values are either 'gce', 'aws', 'azure', 'openstack', or 'vsphere'
## When openstack is used make sure to source in the openstack credentials
## like you would do when using nova-client before starting the playbook.
#cloud_provider:

## When azure is used, you need to also set the following variables.
## see docs/azure.md for details on how to get these values
#azure_tenant_id:
#azure_subscription_id:
#azure_aad_client_id:
#azure_aad_client_secret:
#azure_resource_group:
#azure_location:
#azure_subnet_name:
#azure_security_group_name:
#azure_vnet_name:
#azure_route_table_name:

## Set these proxy values in order to update docker daemon to use proxies
#http_proxy: ""
#https_proxy: ""
#no_proxy: ""

## Uncomment this if you want to force overlay/overlay2 as docker storage driver
## Please note that overlay2 is only supported on newer kernels
#docker_storage_options: -s overlay2

# Uncomment this if you have more than 3 nameservers, then we'll only use the first 3.
#docker_dns_servers_strict: false

## Default packages to install within the cluster, f.e:
#kpm_packages:
#  - name: kube-system/grafana

## Certificate Management
## This setting determines whether certs are generated via scripts or whether a
## cluster of Hashicorp's Vault is started to issue certificates (using etcd
## as a backend). Options are "script" or "vault"
#cert_management: script

## Please specify true if you want to perform a kernel upgrade
kernel_upgrade: false
