## Enable docker_container_storage_setup, it will configure devicemapper driver on Centos7 or RedHat7.

## It must be define a disk path for docker_container_storage_setup_devs.
## Otherwise docker-storage-setup will be executed incorrectly.

## Uncomment this if you have more than 3 nameservers, then we'll only use the first 3.

## An obvious use case is allowing insecure-registry access to self hosted registries.
## Can be ipaddress and domain_name.
## example define 172.19.16.11 or mirror.registry.io
# docker_insecure_registries:
#   - mirror.registry.io
#   - 172.19.16.11

## Add other registry,example China registry mirror.

#   - https://registry.docker-cn.com
#   - https://mirror.aliyuncs.com

## If non-empty will override default system MountFlags value.
## This option takes a mount propagation flag: shared, slave

# docker_mount_flags:

## A string of extra options to pass to the docker daemon.
