# Kubernetes Branding Guidelines

These guidelines provide you with guidance for using the Kubespray logo.
All artwork is made available under the Linux Foundation trademark usage
[guidelines](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/trademark-usage/). This text from
those guidelines, and the correct and incorrect usage examples, are particularly
helpful:
>Certain marks of The Linux Foundation have been created to enable you to
>communicate compatibility or interoperability of software or products. In
>addition to the requirement that any use of a mark to make an assertion of
>compatibility must, of course, be accurate, the use of these marks must
>avoid confusion regarding The Linux Foundation’s association with the
>product. The use of the mark cannot imply that The Linux Foundation or
>its projects are sponsoring or endorsing the product.

Additionally, permission is granted to modify the Kubespray mark for non-commercial uses such as t-shirts and stickers.
