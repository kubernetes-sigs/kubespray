                        will take precedence over other DNS zone matches, so a solver
                        specifying sys.example.com will be selected over one specifying
                        example.com for the domain www.sys.example.com. If multiple
                        solvers match with the same dnsZones value, the solver with
                        the most matching labels in matchLabels will be selected.
                        If neither has more matches, the solver defined earlier in
                        the list will be selected.
