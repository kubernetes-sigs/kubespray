## Directory where the binaries will be installed
bin_dir: /usr/local/bin

## The access_ip variable is used to define how other nodes should access
## the node.  This is used in flannel to allow other flannel nodes to see
## this node for example.  The access_ip is really useful AWS and Google
## environments where the nodes are accessed remotely by the "public" ip,
## but don't know about that address themselves.
# access_ip: 1.1.1.1


## External LB example config
## apiserver_loadbalancer_domain_name: "elb.some.domain"
# loadbalancer_apiserver:
#   address: 1.2.3.4
#   port: 1234

## Internal loadbalancers for apiservers
# loadbalancer_apiserver_localhost: true
# valid options are "nginx" or "haproxy"
# loadbalancer_apiserver_type: nginx  # valid values "nginx" or "haproxy"

## If the cilium is going to be used in strict mode, we can use the
## localhost connection and not use the external LB. If this parameter is
## not specified, the first node to connect to kubeapi will be used.
# use_localhost_as_kubeapi_loadbalancer: true

## Local loadbalancer should use this port
## And must be set port 6443
loadbalancer_apiserver_port: 6443

## If loadbalancer_apiserver_healthcheck_port variable defined, enables proxy liveness check for nginx.
loadbalancer_apiserver_healthcheck_port: 8081

### OTHER OPTIONAL VARIABLES

## By default, Kubespray collects nameservers on the host. It then adds the previously collected nameservers in nameserverentries.
## If true, Kubespray does not include host nameservers in nameserverentries in dns_late stage. However, It uses the nameserver to make sure cluster installed safely in dns_early stage.
## Use this option with caution, you may need to define your dns servers. Otherwise, the outbound queries such as www.google.com may fail.
# disable_host_nameservers: false

## Upstream dns servers
# upstream_dns_servers:
#   - 8.8.8.8
#   - 8.8.4.4

## There are some changes specific to the cloud providers
## for instance we need to encapsulate packets with some network plugins
## If set the possible values are either 'gce', 'aws', 'azure', 'openstack', 'vsphere', 'oci', or 'external'
## When openstack is used make sure to source in the openstack credentials
## like you would do when using openstack-client before starting the playbook.
# cloud_provider:

## When cloud_provider is set to 'external', you can set the cloud controller to deploy
## Supported cloud controllers are: 'openstack', 'vsphere' and 'hcloud'
## When openstack or vsphere are used make sure to source in the required fields
# external_cloud_provider:

## Set these proxy values in order to update package manager and docker daemon to use proxies
# http_proxy: ""
# https_proxy: ""

## Refer to roles/kubespray-defaults/defaults/main.yml before modifying no_proxy
# no_proxy: ""

## Some problems may occur when downloading files over https proxy due to ansible bug
## https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/32750. Set this variable to False to disable
## SSL validation of get_url module. Note that kubespray will still be performing checksum validation.
# download_validate_certs: False

## If you need exclude all cluster nodes from proxy and other resources, add other resources here.
# additional_no_proxy: ""

## If you need to disable proxying of os package repositories but are still behind an http_proxy set
## skip_http_proxy_on_os_packages to true
## This will cause kubespray not to set proxy environment in /etc/yum.conf for centos and in /etc/apt/apt.conf for debian/ubuntu
## Special information for debian/ubuntu - you have to set the no_proxy variable, then apt package will install from your source of wish
# skip_http_proxy_on_os_packages: false

## Since workers are included in the no_proxy variable by default, docker engine will be restarted on all nodes (all
## pods will restart) when adding or removing workers.  To override this behaviour by only including master nodes in the
## no_proxy variable, set below to true:
no_proxy_exclude_workers: false

## Certificate Management
## This setting determines whether certs are generated via scripts.
## Chose 'none' if you provide your own certificates.
## Option is  "script", "none"
# cert_management: script

## Set to true to allow pre-checks to fail and continue deployment
# ignore_assert_errors: false

## The read-only port for the Kubelet to serve on with no authentication/authorization. Uncomment to enable.
# kube_read_only_port: 10255

## Set true to download and cache container
# download_container: true

## Deploy container engine
# Set false if you want to deploy container engine manually.
# deploy_container_engine: true

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription registration
## Add either RHEL subscription Username/Password or Organization ID/Activation Key combination
## Update RHEL subscription purpose usage, role and SLA if necessary
# rh_subscription_username: ""
# rh_subscription_password: ""
# rh_subscription_org_id: ""
# rh_subscription_activation_key: ""
# rh_subscription_usage: "Development"
# rh_subscription_role: "Red Hat Enterprise Server"
# rh_subscription_sla: "Self-Support"

## Check if access_ip responds to ping. Set false if your firewall blocks ICMP.
# ping_access_ip: true

# sysctl_file_path to add sysctl conf to
# sysctl_file_path: "/etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf"

## Variables for webhook token auth https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#webhook-token-authentication
kube_webhook_token_auth: false
kube_webhook_token_auth_url_skip_tls_verify: false
# kube_webhook_token_auth_url: https://...
## base64-encoded string of the webhook's CA certificate
# kube_webhook_token_auth_ca_data: "LS0t..."

## NTP Settings
# Start the ntpd or chrony service and enable it at system boot.
ntp_enabled: false
