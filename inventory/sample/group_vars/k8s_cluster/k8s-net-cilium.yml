# Identity allocation mode selects how identities are shared between cilium
# nodes by setting how they are stored. The options are "crd" or "kvstore".
# - "crd" stores identities in kubernetes as CRDs (custom resource definition).
#   These can be queried with:
#     `kubectl get ciliumid`
# - "kvstore" stores identities in an etcd kvstore.
# - In order to support External Workloads, "crd" is required
#   - Ref: https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/external-workloads/#setting-up-support-for-external-workloads-beta
# - KVStore operations are only required when cilium-operator is running with any of the below options:
#   - --synchronize-k8s-services
#   - --synchronize-k8s-nodes

# Allows to explicitly specify the IPv4 CIDR for native routing.
# When specified, Cilium assumes networking for this CIDR is preconfigured and

# applying any SNAT.
# Generally speaking, specifying a native routing CIDR implies that Cilium can
# depend on the underlying networking stack to route packets to their
# destination. To offer a concrete example, if Cilium is configured to use
# direct routing and the Kubernetes CIDR is included in the native routing CIDR,
# the user must configure the routes to reach pods, either manually or by
