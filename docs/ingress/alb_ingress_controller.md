# AWS ALB Ingress Controller

**NOTE:** The current image version is `v1.1.9`. Please file any issues you find and note the version used.

The AWS ALB Ingress Controller satisfies Kubernetes [ingress resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) by provisioning [Application Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html).

This project was originated by [Ticketmaster](https://github.com/ticketmaster) and [CoreOS](https://github.com/coreos) as part of Ticketmaster's move to AWS and CoreOS Tectonic. Learn more about Ticketmaster's Kubernetes initiative from Justin Dean's video at [Tectonic Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqXVKneP0Hg).

This project was donated to Kubernetes SIG-AWS to allow AWS, CoreOS, Ticketmaster and other SIG-AWS contributors to officially maintain the project. SIG-AWS reached this consensus on June 1, 2018.
