# Upgrading Kubernetes in Kubespray

Kubespray handles upgrades the same way it handles initial deployment. That is to
say that each component is laid down in a fixed order.

You can also individually control versions of components by explicitly defining their
versions. Here are all version vars for each component:

* docker_version
* docker_containerd_version (relevant when `container_manager` == `docker`)
* containerd_version (relevant when `container_manager` == `containerd`)
* kube_version
* etcd_version
* calico_version
* calico_cni_version
* weave_version
* flannel_version
* kubedns_version

See [Multiple Upgrades](#multiple-upgrades) for how to upgrade from older Kubespray release to the latest release

## Unsafe upgrade example

If you wanted to upgrade just kube_version from v1.18.10 to v1.19.7, you could
deploy the following way:

```ShellSession
ansible-playbook cluster.yml -i inventory/sample/hosts.ini -e kube_version=v1.18.10 -e upgrade_cluster_setup=true
```

And then repeat with v1.19.7 as kube_version:

```ShellSession
ansible-playbook cluster.yml -i inventory/sample/hosts.ini -e kube_version=v1.19.7 -e upgrade_cluster_setup=true
```

The var ```-e upgrade_cluster_setup=true``` is needed to be set in order to migrate the deploys of e.g kube-apiserver inside the cluster immediately which is usually only done in the graceful upgrade. (Refer to [#4139](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/issues/4139) and [#4736](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/issues/4736))

## Graceful upgrade

Kubespray also supports cordon, drain and uncordoning of nodes when performing
a cluster upgrade. There is a separate playbook used for this purpose. It is
important to note that upgrade-cluster.yml can only be used for upgrading an
existing cluster. That means there must be at least 1 kube_control_plane already
deployed.

```ShellSession
ansible-playbook upgrade-cluster.yml -b -i inventory/sample/hosts.ini -e kube_version=v1.19.7
```

After a successful upgrade, the Server Version should be updated:

```ShellSession
$ kubectl version
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"19", GitVersion:"v1.19.7", GitCommit:"1dd5338295409edcfff11505e7bb246f0d325d15", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2021-01-13T13:23:52Z", GoVersion:"go1.15.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"19", GitVersion:"v1.19.7", GitCommit:"1dd5338295409edcfff11505e7bb246f0d325d15", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2021-01-13T13:15:20Z", GoVersion:"go1.15.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```

### Pausing the upgrade

If you want to manually control the upgrade procedure, you can set some variables to pause the upgrade playbook. Pausing *before* upgrading each upgrade may be useful for inspecting pods running on that node, or performing manual actions on the node:

* `upgrade_node_confirm: true` - This will pause the playbook execution prior to upgrading each node. The play will resume when manually approved by typing "yes" at the terminal.
* `upgrade_node_pause_seconds: 60` - This will pause the playbook execution for 60 seconds prior to upgrading each node. The play will resume automatically after 60 seconds.

Pausing *after* upgrading each node may be useful for rebooting the node to apply kernel updates, or testing the still-cordoned node:

* `upgrade_node_post_upgrade_confirm: true` - This will pause the playbook execution after upgrading each node, but before the node is uncordoned. The play will resume when manually approved by typing "yes" at the terminal.
* `upgrade_node_post_upgrade_pause_seconds: 60` - This will pause the playbook execution for 60 seconds after upgrading each node, but before the node is uncordoned. The play will resume automatically after 60 seconds.

## Node-based upgrade

If you don't want to upgrade all nodes in one run, you can use `--limit` [patterns](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_patterns.html#patterns-and-ansible-playbook-flags).

Before using `--limit` run playbook `facts.yml` without the limit to refresh facts cache for all nodes:

```ShellSession
ansible-playbook facts.yml -b -i inventory/sample/hosts.ini
```

After this upgrade control plane and etcd groups [#5147](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/issues/5147):

```ShellSession
ansible-playbook upgrade-cluster.yml -b -i inventory/sample/hosts.ini -e kube_version=v1.20.7 --limit "kube_control_plane:etcd"
```

Now you can upgrade other nodes in any order and quantity:

```ShellSession
ansible-playbook upgrade-cluster.yml -b -i inventory/sample/hosts.ini -e kube_version=v1.20.7 --limit "node4:node6:node7:node12"
ansible-playbook upgrade-cluster.yml -b -i inventory/sample/hosts.ini -e kube_version=v1.20.7 --limit "node5*"
```

## Multiple upgrades

> **Warning**
> [Do not skip releases when upgrading--upgrade by one tag at a time.](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/issues/3849#issuecomment-451386515)

For instance, if you're on v2.6.0, then check out v2.7.0, run the upgrade, check out the next tag, and run the next upgrade, etc.

Assuming you don't explicitly define a kubernetes version in your k8s_cluster.yml, you simply check out the next tag and run the upgrade-cluster.yml playbook

* If you do define kubernetes version in your inventory (e.g. group_vars/k8s_cluster.yml) then either make sure to update it before running upgrade-cluster, or specify the new version you're upgrading to: `ansible-playbook -i inventory/mycluster/hosts.ini -b upgrade-cluster.yml -e kube_version=v1.11.3`

  Otherwise, the upgrade will leave your cluster at the same k8s version defined in your inventory vars.

The below example shows taking a cluster that was set up for v2.6.0 up to v2.10.0

```ShellSession
$ kubectl get node

Some deprecations between versions that mean you can't just upgrade straight from 2.7.0 to 2.8.0 if you started with the sample inventory.

In this case, I set "kubeadm_enabled" to false, knowing that it is deprecated and removed by 2.9.0, to delay converting the cluster to kubeadm as long as I could.

```ShellSession

If you do not keep your inventory copy up to date, **your upgrade will fail** and your first master will be left non-functional until fixed and re-run.

It is at this point the cluster was upgraded from non-kubeadm to kubeadm as per the deprecation warning.

## Upgrading to v2.19

`etcd_kubeadm_enabled` is being deprecated at v2.19. The same functionality is achievable by setting `etcd_deployment_type` to `kubeadm`.
Deploying etcd using kubeadm is experimental and is only available for either new or deployments where `etcd_kubeadm_enabled` was set to `true` while deploying the cluster.

From 2.19 and onward `etcd_deployment_type` variable will be placed in `group_vars/all/etcd.yml` instead of `group_vars/etcd.yml`, due to scope issues.
The placement of the variable is only important for `etcd_deployment_type: kubeadm` right now. However, since this might change in future updates, it is recommended to move the variable.

Upgrading is straightforward; no changes are required if `etcd_kubeadm_enabled` was not set to `true` when deploying.

If you have a cluster where `etcd` was deployed using `kubeadm`, you will need to remove `etcd_kubeadm_enabled` the variable. Then move `etcd_deployment_type` variable from `group_vars/etcd.yml` to `group_vars/all/etcd.yml` due to scope issues and set `etcd_deployment_type` to `kubeadm`.

## Upgrade order

As mentioned above, components are upgraded in the order in which they were
installed in the Ansible playbook. The order of component installation is as
follows:

* Docker
* Containerd
* etcd
* kubelet and kube-proxy
* network_plugin (such as Calico or Weave)
* kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, and kube-controller-manager
* Add-ons (such as KubeDNS)

### Component-based upgrades

A deployer may want to upgrade specific components in order to minimize risk
or save time. This strategy is not covered by CI as of this writing, so it is
not guaranteed to work.

These commands are useful only for upgrading fully-deployed, healthy, existing
hosts. This will definitely not work for undeployed or partially deployed
hosts.

Upgrade docker:

```ShellSession
ansible-playbook -b -i inventory/sample/hosts.ini cluster.yml --tags=docker
```

Upgrade etcd:

```ShellSession
ansible-playbook -b -i inventory/sample/hosts.ini cluster.yml --tags=etcd
```

Upgrade etcd without rotating etcd certs:

```ShellSession
ansible-playbook -b -i inventory/sample/hosts.ini cluster.yml --tags=etcd --limit=etcd --skip-tags=etcd-secrets
```

Upgrade kubelet:

```ShellSession
ansible-playbook -b -i inventory/sample/hosts.ini cluster.yml --tags=node --skip-tags=k8s-gen-certs,k8s-gen-tokens
```

Upgrade Kubernetes master components:

```ShellSession
ansible-playbook -b -i inventory/sample/hosts.ini cluster.yml --tags=master
```

Upgrade network plugins:

```ShellSession
ansible-playbook -b -i inventory/sample/hosts.ini cluster.yml --tags=network
```

Upgrade all add-ons:

```ShellSession
ansible-playbook -b -i inventory/sample/hosts.ini cluster.yml --tags=apps
```

Upgrade just helm (assuming `helm_enabled` is true):

```ShellSession
ansible-playbook -b -i inventory/sample/hosts.ini cluster.yml --tags=helm
```

## Migrate from Docker to Containerd

Please note that **migrating container engines is not officially supported by Kubespray**. While this procedure can be used to migrate your cluster, it applies to one particular scenario and will likely evolve over time. At the moment, they are intended as an additional resource to provide insight into how these steps can be officially integrated into the Kubespray playbooks.

As of Kubespray 2.18.0, containerd is already the default container engine. If you have the chance, it is advisable and safer to reset and redeploy the entire cluster with a new container engine.
