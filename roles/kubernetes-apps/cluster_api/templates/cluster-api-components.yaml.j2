                          is required by autoscaler to be able to have a provider

                          find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.

                          higher level entities like autoscaler that will be interfacing

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api.
                          Example use case is cluster autoscaler with cluster-api
                          as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines
                          to nodes to find out machines at provider which could not
                          get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as
                          a generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field
                          is required by autoscaler to be able to have a provider
                          view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried
                          from the k8s apiserver and then a comparison is done to
                          find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by
                          higher level entities like autoscaler that will be interfacing
                          with cluster-api as generic provider.

                  by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster
                  autoscaler with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler
                  compares machines to nodes to find out machines at provider which

                  and are marked for delete. This field will be set by the actuators
                  and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will

                  by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster
                  autoscaler with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler
                  compares machines to nodes to find out machines at provider which
                  could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as
                  a generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required
                  by autoscaler to be able to have a provider view of the list of
                  machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                  and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines
                  and are marked for delete. This field will be set by the actuators
                  and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                  be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          any time limitations. NOTE: NodeDrainTimeout is different

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api.
                          Example use case is cluster autoscaler with cluster-api
                          as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines
                          to nodes to find out machines at provider which could not
                          get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as
                          a generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field
                          is required by autoscaler to be able to have a provider
                          view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried
                          from the k8s apiserver and then a comparison is done to
                          find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by
                          higher level entities like autoscaler that will be interfacing
                          with cluster-api as generic provider.

                  wrong with the MachineTemplate's spec or the configuration of the
                  machine controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples
                  of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in
                  the spec, values that are unsupported by the machine controller,
                  or the responsible machine controller itself being critically misconfigured.
