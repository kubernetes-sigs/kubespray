Deployment files
================

This directory contains example deployment manifests for cert-manager that can
be used in place of the official Helm chart.

This is useful if you are deploying cert-manager into an environment without
Helm, or want to inspect a 'bare minimum' deployment.

Where do these come from?
-------------------------

The manifests in these subdirectories are generated from the Helm chart
automatically. The `values.yaml` files used to configure cert-manager can be
found in [`hack/deploy`](../../hack/deploy/).

They are automatically generated by running `./hack/update-deploy-gen.sh`.
